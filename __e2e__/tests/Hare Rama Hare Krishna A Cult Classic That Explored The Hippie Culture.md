The film is set in the backdrop of the rise of the International Hare Krishna movement in the 1970s, and revolves around a Montreal-based family of the Jaiswals, who get separated due to irreconcilable differences. Jasbir, the daughter, goes with her mother to Canada, while Prashant, the son, stays with his father in India. Years later, Prashant travels to Kathmandu to find his sister, who has joined a group of hippies and adopted the name Janice. He tries to persuade her to return to India and reunite with their father, but faces resistance from her hippie friends and her drug-addicted boyfriend.
 
The film was inspired by Dev Anand's encounter with a hippie girl in Nepal during the making of his previous film Prem Pujari. He decided to make a film on the hippie culture and its impact on Indian youth. He also introduced R.D. Burman as the music director, who composed some of the most memorable songs of Hindi cinema, such as "Dum Maro Dum", "Phoolon Ka Taron Ka" and "Kanchi Re Kanchi". The film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the hippie lifestyle and its social commentary on drug abuse, alienation and spiritual quest.
 
Hare Rama Hare Krishna is considered a cult classic and one of Dev Anand's finest works. It has been praised for its bold theme, engaging story, powerful performances and catchy music. It also influenced many filmmakers and actors who explored similar topics in their films. The film has been remade in several languages, such as Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.
  
The film received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography and editing. Dev Anand was praised for his vision and courage to tackle a sensitive and controversial subject with honesty and sensitivity. He also received appreciation for his acting skills and chemistry with both Mumtaz and Zeenat Aman. Mumtaz played the role of Shanti, a simple and innocent girl who falls in love with Prashant and helps him in his mission. She was lauded for her comic timing and emotional expressions. Zeenat Aman stole the show with her portrayal of Jasbir/Janice, a rebellious and troubled hippie who suffers from a broken family and drug addiction. She was hailed as a new sensation and a style icon for her unconventional looks and outfits.
 
The film also had a huge impact on the society and culture of India. It exposed the dark side of the hippie movement and its influence on the Indian youth. It also highlighted the importance of family values and bonds, and the need for spiritual awakening. The film also popularized the Hare Krishna chant and the ISKON movement, though it was not directly associated with them. Many people became curious about the teachings of Krishna and joined the ISKON temples. The film also inspired many other filmmakers and actors to explore similar themes in their films, such as Shakti Samanta's Anuraag (1972), Raj Kapoor's Bobby (1973), Ramesh Sippy's Sholay (1975) and Manmohan Desai's Amar Akbar Anthony (1977).
 
Hare Rama Hare Krishna is a landmark film in the history of Indian cinema. It is regarded as one of the best films of Dev Anand and one of the finest examples of musical drama genre. It is also one of the most influential films of all time, as it changed the course of Hindi cinema and culture. It is a film that transcends time and generations, and remains relevant and entertaining even today.
